            <h2 style="background-color:rgb(187, 219, 235);">Self introduction</h2>
            <p>I am currently a senior student pursuing my Bachelor's degree. I have spent three years studying at Wenzheng 
                College of Soochow University, majoring in Internet of Things Engineering. Additionally, I had the privilege of studying
                 for one year at the University of Idaho, majoring in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>In my three years at Wenzheng College, I delved into a wide range of subjects in the field of Internet of Things Engineering. 
                I studied key concepts such as sensor technology, embedded systems, and communication protocols, which form the foundational
                 knowledge required for building smart devices and IoT applications. I also actively participated in projects related to smart
                  agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes, which honed my problem-solving and teamwork skills. Through active engagement 
                  in academic research and practical projects, I achieved excellent academic performance in the field of Internet of Things 
                  Engineering.</p>
            <p>During my year at the University of Idaho, I immersed myself in the core areas of computer science. I engaged in coursework
                 that covered various aspects, including data structures, algorithm design, database management, artificial intelligence, 
                 and more. This year of study provided me with an opportunity to explore the depths of computer science, enriching my
                  programming skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>
            <p>My dual-degree background equips me with both the technical prowess of Internet of Things Engineering and the software
                 skills of Computer Science. I look forward to merging these two knowledge domains to build a strong foundation for my 
                 future career.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:rgb(187, 219, 235);">Career Development Goals</h2>
            <p>My career aspirations encompass establishing a diversified career in the technology field, 
                making the most of my knowledge and skills in both Internet of Things Engineering and Computer Science.
                 I am passionate about driving technological innovations, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
                 The advancements in AI have already reshaped various aspects of our world, and I aspire to actively participate in 
                 cutting-edge research and applications. I have a keen interest in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, 
                 and their applications in areas such as autonomous systems, robotics, and data analysis.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, I hold a profound fascination for the field of cybersecurity. In an era dominated by digitalization,
                 securing sensitive information and networks is of paramount importance. Cybersecurity not only involves safeguarding data from
                  unauthorized access but also encompasses ethical hacking and proactive risk management to ensure the resilience of our digital
                   ecosystem.</p>
                
            <p>My long-term career goal is to achieve excellence in the technology field, not only driving technolo
                gical innovations but also making a positive contribution to society. I look forward to collaborating with like-minded p
                rofessionals, continuously learning and growing, and realizing my career aspirations.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color:rgb(187, 219, 235);">Research Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Intelligent Agriculture (July 2023)</p>
            <p><strong>Research Aim:</strong> The objective of this project was to leverage IoT technology to enhance the efficiency and
                 quality of agricultural production while concurrently reducing production costs and resource consumption</p>
            <p><strong>Research Process:</strong> To achieve this aim, I installed temperature and humidity sensor equipment within the 
                agricultural production environment. I used hardware equipment and software tools to monitor environmental data in real-time, 
                ensuring that the conditions were optimal for crop growth. Subsequently, I conducted comprehensive data analysis and processing 
                to provide valuable data and technical support for intelligent agricultural management. This research not only deepened my 
                understanding of IoT technology but also offered innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture and food production.</p>
            <p>Through this research experience, I learned how to apply technology to address real-world challenges,
                 handle vast amounts of data, and collaborate with teams to achieve common goals. I look forward to applying
                  these experiences to future research projects and continuing to contribute to the advancement of science and technology.
