            <h2 style="background-color:rgb(187, 219, 235);">Hobbies</h2>
            <p>One of my most cherished pastimes is painting traditional Chinese landscapes,
                a hobby that has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. 
                Since the age of six, I've been captivated by the art of Chinese painting, 
                spending countless hours perfecting my techniques. 
                The delicate strokes of the brush,
                the use of ink and color, and the profound symbolism behind
                 each painting have always fascinated me.
                 Over the years, my dedication paid off, and I proudly 
                 earned a 10th-grade certificate in Chinese painting.</p>
           <p>My journey in the world of Chinese painting has been a remarkable one. 
               I've had the privilege of capturing the essence of nature,
                emulating famous masterpieces, and even crafting my original compositions. 
                These paintings often depict serene landscapes, graceful plum blossoms, 
                or majestic mountains, offering a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage of China.</p>
           <p>Another passion that fuels my life is table tennis, or as it's more commonly known, ping pong. 
               I've been honing my skills on the table for six years, and during that time, 
               I've participated in numerous provincial-level competitions in the youth category. 
               While I haven't always clinched the top prize, I'm proud to say that I've earned several 
               third-place finishes 
               in these highly competitive events.</p>
           <p>Table tennis is more than just a sport for me; it's a way to stay physically active, 
               sharpen my reflexes, and experience the thrill of competition.
                The rhythmic sound of the ball bouncing on the table and the quick exchanges across 
                the net provide an exhilarating experience that keeps me coming back for more.</p>
